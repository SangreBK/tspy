Each character has its own personal base, called **Apartments**. Like bases, they can be given a code and accessed freely by anyone who has it. No more making a whole supergroup for one character's base!

The base builder also has an enormous selection of objects, which can be used in combination with different placement methods to create incredibly unique bases.
