Thunderspy features a number of unconventional and new powersets such as **Hard Life** (*Tankers with shotguns*), **Spectral Melee** and **Aura** *(Stalkers with ghost minions and a focus on fear)*, Knights (*melee Masterminds with medieval minions*), **Tarantula Training** (*A new path for widows that turns them into monstrous Tarantulas*) - and more!

Additionally, there have been a number of power changes and improvements, some of the most notable being:

* **Old and neglected powersets have been brought to the forefront once more through buffs and new mechanics**. Some examples are Assault Rifle, Empathy, and *ALL* Mastermind sets!
* Controllers and Dominators now **get their pets at level 1**
* All support sets that apply shielding *(Forcefields, Thermal, etc)* **also give half their effect to the caster.**
* Defenders have **a new inherent ability that boosts their support effects**, and they **can also pick certain melee sets as secondaries**! This synergizes very well with the support changes.
