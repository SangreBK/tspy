Thunderspy boasts the most updated character creator out of any private server. New and updated body and face sliders allow you to make more unique character shapes than ever before, while the color palette has been expanded to any hue imaginable.

Some other notable additions include:

* New and original heads, shoulders, gloves, legs, textures, and even a new 'Outerwear' slot for certain female torsos that feature totally new hoodie and shirt options.
* 'Invisible' textures, allowing you to make a character with no head, arms, or without a body at all.
* More chest and head detail slots - two detail 1, two detail 2, two chest details.
* TWO auras, plus additional auras you can specifically for your gloves and chest.
* New NPC parts unlocked through gameplay - Rikti and Rikti heads, Behemoth heads, that cool Council claw arm. <a href="/guides/npc-parts">(How?)</a>
* Freakshow scythe/hammer/claw arms and jagged metal shoulder pieces, even the Stunner backpack for males!
