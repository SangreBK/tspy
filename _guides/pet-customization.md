title: Pet Customization
---
On Thunderspy, any pet can be customized - Mastermind minion, Controller/Dominator pet, veteran vanity pet, etc. If it can be named, it can be given a custom costume! Certain non-humanoid pets (Robots, Beasts) will have broken animations, but anything that uses the human skeleton will animate as expected.

To customize a pet, rename it, then right click it and select 'Edit Costume'. Make something you're happy with, then simply hit 'Next'. And you're all set!

***Be sure you save your minion's costume, since you can't go in and retrieve it later!!***
