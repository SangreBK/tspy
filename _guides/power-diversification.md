On Thunderspy, you have the option of 5 max power pools over the vanilla limit of 4. This change was made because ***all power pool attacks have been buffed to be just as good as primary/secondary powers***! This makes them powerful and viable options to train in.

You can also directly train into a power you want at the appropriate level. For example, if you want to take tough or weave, you just have to be level 14 or higher - you no longer need to take kick or boxing! (Unless you really want to.)
