The Thunderspy site is currently set up to swap between four languages - English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. All text on the site is able to be swapped out for any of these languages, but presently we only have English, so we haven't added a language button just yet to swap to them. **We need help translating!**

Want to contribute? [Hop into the back-end with a github account and you can start helping us right now](/admin)! No coding knowledge required. Any changes you make will be posted for review by one of the repo managers, and once approved, they'll be pushed to the live site. 

Just make your changes, save, then set the status to 'in review' to let us know it's ready to look over.

When viewing the site in a non-english language, anything that's untranslated will have a notice nearby suggesting how to help (which may be how you got here).
