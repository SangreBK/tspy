The enhancement system has been overhauled in order to improve the leveling and gearing up experience. Rather than replacing your enhancements every three levels or getting Invention Origin enhancements ASAP, the base TO/DO/SOs have been buffed and are good for whole brackets of levels!

* **Training Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by **15%**, and **can be slotted at any level below 15**.
* **Dual Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by **25%**, and can **be slotted at any level between 15 and 30**.
* **Single Origin** enhancements have been buffed to enhance by 35%, and **can be slotted at any level above 30**.
* **Invention origin** enhancements can no longer be slotted beneath their level (no Lv25 IOs at level 22 anymore)



###### Additional Enhancement Slots

You have an additonal 4 total enhancement slots available to distribute, for a total of 71 (over the vanilla 67)
