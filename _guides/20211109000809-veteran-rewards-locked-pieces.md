###### Locked Powers & Pieces

When you first start on Thunderspy, you'll see some costumes and powers locked with a shopping cart next to them. You can simply click the shopping cart and immediately unlock those items, it's just some leftover code.

###### Paragon Rewards

You're given enough tokens to fill out the entire VIP benefits tree. To reach it, click 'menu' on your health bar, followed by 'Paragon Rewards', then simply apply all your tokens. Tokens are awarded weekly. *(Weekly, meaning when the haunted code thinks it's okay.)*
